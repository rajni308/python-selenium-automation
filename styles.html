                    <li>Seasoning– Italian seasoning, basil, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper make this dish super flavorful!</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Slice the eggplant
Cut the eggplant into even 1/4″ slices. This will ensure the eggplant sweats quickly and cooks evenly and at the same time.</li>
            <li>Sweat the eggplant
Eggplants hold a ton of water, which without sweating the eggplant, will inhibit the slices from crisping. After slicing the eggplant, lay them on a cooling rack and sprinkle them with salt on both sides.<br> Allow the eggplant to sit for 15 minutes. Use a paper towel to blot the excess liquid after they have sweat for 15 minutes.
